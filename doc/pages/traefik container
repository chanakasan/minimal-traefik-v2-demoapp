* traefik container doesn't accept requests from all exposed ports
instead it accepts requests from all entrypoints,
as the name suggest

* if expose 5000:5000 but don't create an entrypoint
visiting port 5000 won't reach traefik container
Even though the port is exposed in the container, there's no server listening on that port

* 404 is displayed for any request at available entrypoints
 that doesn't have a matching router rule
